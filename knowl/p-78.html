<p>The proof depends on a result from real analysis (sometimes called "advanced calculus") that states that \(\sup_{x \in S} f( x ) \) is attained for some vector \(x \in S \) as long as \(f \) is continuous and \(S \) is a compact set. The set of vectors that satisfied \(x \in \C^n \) and \(\| x \|_\nu = 1 \) is a compact set. Since real analysis is not a prerequisite for this course, the reader may have to take this on faith!  From real analysis we also learn that if the supremum is attained by an element in \(S \text{,}\) then \(\sup_{x \in S} f( x ) = \max_{x \in S} f( x ) \text{.}\)</p>
