<p>An example for which it is true: \(A = 0 \) (the zero matrix).  For this matrix, it is easy to show that \(\vert 
\vert \vert \cdot \vert \vert \vert\) is not positive definite.</p>
<p>An example for which it is true: \(A = I \) (the identity matrix).  For this matrix, \(\vert 
\vert \vert \cdot \vert \vert \vert\) is simply \(\| \cdot \| \text{,}\) which is assumed to be a norm.</p>
<p>What would fix this problem so that the answer is ALWAYS?</p>
<p>If \(A \) has linearly independent columns, then \(\vert\vert\vert \cdot \vert\vert\vert \) can be shown to be a norm.  Try it!</p>
<p>Why is this a nice problem?  It test your understanding in a number of ways: </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Do you understand what a norm is?</li>
<li>Do you understand that when the answer is SOMETIMES, you need to provide an example of when it is true and an example of when it is false?</li>
<li>Is your linear algebra background strong enough to survive this course?  (If you don't know what a matrix with linearly independent columns is, you need to go back and review your introductory linear algebra understanding.  You can do so by reviewing our undergraduate course "Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers" (LAFF).</li>
