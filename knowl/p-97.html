<p>Second, the "\(\sup\)" (which stands for supremum) is used because we can't claim yet that there is a vector \(x \) with \(\| x \|_\nu = 1 \) for which</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{x \neq 0}
\frac{\| A x \|_\mu}{\| x \|_{\nu}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>or, alternatively, for which</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{\| x \|_\nu = 1}
\| A x \|_\mu.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In other words, it is not immediately obvious that there is a vector for which the supremum is attained. The fact is that there is always such a vector \(x \text{.}\) The proof depends on a result from real analysis (sometimes called "advanced calculus") that states that \(\sup_{x \in S} f( x ) \) is attained for some vector \(x \in S \) as long as \(f \) is continuous and \(S \) is a compact set. The set of vectors that satisfied \(x \in \C^n \) and \(\| x \|_\nu = 1 \) is a compact set. Since real analysis is not a prerequisite for this course, the reader may have to take this on faith!  From real analysis we also learn that if the supremum is attained by an element in \(S \text{,}\) then \(\sup_{x \in S} f( x ) = \max_{x \in S} f( x ) \text{.}\)  Thus, we replace \(\sup \) by \(\max \) from here on in our discussion.</p>
